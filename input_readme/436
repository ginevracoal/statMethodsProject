"1. The viewing surface of the 8 inch mirror is exactly 7.5 inches wide and 2.25 inches high.2. I tried adjustment of the mirror without mounting it. The ball joints on the mirror arm are so tight that adjusting is extremely difficult to nearly impossible.  WD40 did not work, neither did working the joints around to loosen them up.3. So if you try to adjust the mirror after it's mounted, you risk stressing the mounting button glue and the button may fall off.4. When adjusting the mirror, the day/night button kept flipping on/off.  Very annoying.5. The mirror surface itself is very good, no ripples."
