"All of my cheap dollar store garden hose nozzles gave up the ghost this summer. They leaked, sprayed from every angle except the desired one and one, just wouldn't shut off. Cheap Chinese-made Junk! I read the reviews of the Bon-Aire Original Ultimate and it sounded like a take off on NYC's Famous Original Ray's Pizza. However, it was cheap enough so I took a chance. When it arrived, I immediately hooked it up and so far, it's all you could want from a garden hose nozzle. You turn it on or off by turning left or right. The spray patterns go from gentle waterfall to direct stream and all stops in between. I can't tell how long it will last but it looks and feels well made so I give it 4 stars.It could have had 5 stars but, darn, it's made in China. Fairly-priced Chinese-made not-junk!The loss of a star is no reflection on China or the product; just my disappointment that we don't have a hose nozzle this good with a made in the USA sticker on it."
