"Bought one for my car about four years ago. Still using it so got one for my riding mower. Mounted it on the mower so I just plug in, which is great in the cooler months.  I'm in south Louisiana and still have to mow in late November but infrequently, so this keeps it fully charged.  I've had the one o. The mower for a couple seasons now and it's still ticking away."
