"I've been using these things for several years and I buy a new one about every year or so. The Absorber is PVA, so it needs to stay a little wet because it gets very stiff when dry. Once you get used to it and how it works, it's great. There are a lot of PVA drying towels out there that are cheaper, but believe me, this one is superior in thickness and quality. I bought a cheap, generic one at Wal-Mart and it started tearing apart within a couple days.I use mine to wipe down just about anything and everything you'd use a normal towel for. It won't get something as immediately dry to the touch as a towel since it is slightly damp to start with, but evaporation quickly takes care of the rest. The main advantage over a towel is that it works like both a towel and a sponge, depending on how wet it is. It's nice and cool to the touch so it doubles as a cooling cloth in the summer heat. When it gets too wet, you just wring it out. When it gets a little dirty, soak it in a little soap and water and wring it out or throw it in the washer (just make sure you don't put it in the dryer, it comes out of the washer slightly damp, just like it should be stored). Every few washes, I recommend using some bleach in the wash or soaking it with some bleach to help keep it like new."
