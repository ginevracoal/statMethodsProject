"These Camco RV Wheel Chocks are heavy grade injection molded plastic and work well to secure my 5'x10' enclosed trailer in place. These have ridges on the bottom and where it contacts the wheels, which adds extra gripping ability.We picked up four of these Wheel Chocks locally for a little bit less than offered on Amazon.Highly Recommended!CFH"
