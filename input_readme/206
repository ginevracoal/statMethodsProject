"I have been watching these for a while. Came in at Wally World, little over half price.I have used them for years but they DO have an Expiration Date on them... Safety in case they dry out! Excellent for Wheel Chocks in the Garage Too. It grips the concrete and Larger Tires very well.\"BatmanDSM\""
