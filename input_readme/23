"I have owned trucks for many years and gotten by with long lumber though not without some problems from time to time. I originally bought this for use with my kayaks which are 14' long to carry them in the back of the truck with its 6.5' bed. Instead I have been using this extender at least 3 times a month to transport long items.The two pieces fit one inside the other and the overall length is short enough that I can store it behind the seat of the truck until needed. The tubing is heavy enough gauge to support the rated load with no flexing. The two pins needed to attach it to a hitch receiver and to connect the two pieces are provided. The cross bar as multiple holes so I could adjust it for the height of the bed of my truck.There are end loops to use to tie a load and secure it to the bar. The center post also works well as an attachment point for lumber and pipe.I saw similar racks selling for more than twice as much that provided often less strength and no more versatility than this one. Usually after I have tried something like this I see things that I would improve in the design but not so with this bed extender."
