"High quality filter, just like the numerous K&N; filters I've purchased over the years.  Got it from the Amazon Warehouse deals and an awesome price too (about the price of 2 of the cheapest paper filters you can buy).  Fits perfectly in the stock airbox of my 02 Chevy Avalanche.Did I notice any fuel mileage or performance increases?  Of course not...its a nearly 6000lb truck and this is just an air filter."
