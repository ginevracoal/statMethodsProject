"I've used Dynamat for many years now. In my car I didn't manage to eliminate rattles from the trunk (2x jl audio 13w6's), but greatly reduced them. It used to be embarrassing (and sounded bad too) driving with volume up and car rattling being the only audible thing. It's better now because the rattling can only be heard by the trunk on the outside. I used it in the doors, floors, and trunk of my 04' elantra and it dramatically reduced road noise. It also made the stereo sound 10x better in my car. I also used it in the doors and trunk of an 01 Grand Prix, and also reduced road noise and improved stereo quality, but not as dramatically as my car since the grand prix comes with more sound deadening."
