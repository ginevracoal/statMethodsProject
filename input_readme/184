"I've never used a synthetic chamois before, so I'm not sure how well they are supposed to work.  I washed my minivan the other day; and I'd say it took one swipe on a panel, squeeze dry, then a second swipe to completely dry the panel.  The Absorber is a nice, large size.  It dries my car better than old bath towels, and it left no water spots.  I'm very happy with its performance and would buy it again."
