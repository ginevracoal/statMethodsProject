"I bought this to provide extra heat prevention/protection for my short ram intake heat shield. My brand intake is a Neuspeed on my 2012 MKVI Jetta 2.5L SEL.It is easy to shape/trace to the shape of the item being wrapped and easy to cut/place. So far, the heat wrap has lasted and I see no peeling, especially after having lasted through two heavy days of raining. I did a temp-check with remote thermostats and found an additional 67F difference with the heat shield being wrapped versus not. A definite difference and benefit from before -- after! I will post a picture this evening to go along with my review."
