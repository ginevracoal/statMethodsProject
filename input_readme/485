"Bottles were bigger than expected (like pledge bottle size but a little fatter). The box was strong and in good shape. Products came on time (surprised with UPS lol). Wally World wanted same price for smaller ones. I would buy again. What you see in picture is what you get (aside from the K and N box)."
