"The Absorber is made of polyvinyl alcohol which allows it to be super absorbent and reusable.  It comes in a plastic tube which serves as a holder for the Absorber and I would suggest you store it in there since the Absorber should be stored moist so it does not break down and stiffen.  The product really does absorb a lot of water and is the best car dryer I have ever had.  After you wash the car run the Absorber over the car and 90% of the water gets removed.  When the towel gets saturated, just wring it out and start drying again.  It cuts car drying time at least in half, maybe more, plus the effort to dry with this towel is less than with a standard towel or chamois.  If the car is in the sun or if you have hard water or if you are meticulous about your car, it may be a good thing to run a microfiber towel over the car after you use the Absorber to get the rest of the water off and to ensure no spots/streaks get  left behind.  When you are done, just wring most of the water out of the Absorber and roll it back into its plastic container for next time.  This is a great product for car drying or for cleaning up wet spills.  I highly recommended it for those purposes.  I am hesitant to recommend using it on your body since it sits in a moist, bacteria-friendly environment between uses - but as a car dryer it is terrific.  I comparison shop a lot before buying anything - hopefully you can benefit from my time investment and review."
