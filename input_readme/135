"Very useful charger. I mounted it in the engine bay near the battery and it works as intended.Only downside to this charger is the length of the plug cord. It worked well for my application though because i mounted it in tandem with a flush-mount sealed power port on the side of the vehicle.It allowed my battery to remain topped up and warm enough to start at 35 below zero like it was no big deal.I will be ordering a second for an other vehicle."
