"This product is an effective way to remove dust and pollen in between car washes. I have used it for several years without any problems, and recently bought a new one to replace the one that got ruined in Hurricane Irene this past summer (my garage was flooded). Here is why I like it:1. This cleans without harming the car finish or leaving streaks.IMPORTANT: Follow the directions to place this on newspaper for 48 hours before first use. That is to get rid of excess wax that can cause streaking.2. This covers a large area, so the time to clean is reduced.3. This is easy to clean (just shake it out) and works great no matter how dirty it gets.4. This is well made and durable.Note: This is not a substitute for going to a car wash or using other cleaners. It does nothing, for example, to remove water spots or bird droppings. It also does nothing to give your car the shine that only wax can do. But it is a great way to maintain your car in between car washes."
