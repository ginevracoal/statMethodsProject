"I really like these high-quality, \"fireman-type\", and high-output nozzles. They are built VERY WELL and output a lot of water. If you don't want high water output, then don't get this nozzle, otherwise, I would highly recommend spending more money to get one of these rather than the cheaper nozzles. I think it's worth it."
