"After reading many of the reviews here, my expectations were probably set too high.  Many purchasers have made this thing sound like it sprinkles water from the fountain of youth at pressures to rival Old Faithful.It is well made and should last many years.  Other than that, it sprays out water prett much like any other hose nozzle I have ever used.  It is a quality product but I do not understand all the raves."
