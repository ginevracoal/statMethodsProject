"Needed to replace a broken mirror.  This one fit right onto the existing metal holder that was still cemented to the windshield.  It has a lock-screw to hold it in place.  If you need to replace the metal holder, it is included but no glue is supplied.  Overall, it is a perfectly fine basic mirror."
