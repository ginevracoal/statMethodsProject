"Put this on the lid of my trunk and it decreased the rattling from my subs big time. I have a hyundai Elantra and the trunk lid is absolute garbage. The aluminum is extremely thin and flexes like crazy. This little bit of dynamat made the whole trunk sound much more solid and reduced the flexing. I highly recommend it.I also recommend getting the dynamat roller if you don't have one."
