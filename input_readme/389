"Fram has a horrific history of manufacturing oil filters that fail. Their filters leak and do a poor job at filtering impurities. There are websites devoted to discussing oil and oil filters and Fram products are nearly universally criticized and avoided. There are also videos online that investigate Fram oil filters and they are nearly all universally negative.Purolator, Wix (NAPA), Mann, Mahle, are some quality filters. Fram are the worst filters and you are risking harming your bike."
