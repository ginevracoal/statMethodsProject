"If you need a new tire cover and don't care about having something printed on it give this a look. It just fit my 255-70 R15 tires on my Jeep and has held up for about 12 month since it was installed. The only this I have noticed about it is that it is very hard to keep it looking clean and black without dirt streaks in it."
