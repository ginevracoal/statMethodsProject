"I used to take my car to the mechanics and they would hook it up to their diagnostic machine. If they diagnosed my car and I didn't use their services, the fee was $50. Otherwise, if I used their services it was a free diagnostic but I had to pay for the repair. Now I can self-diagnose my car and instantly know what is wrong with it before shopping around for the repair. I used the Actron CP9135 today when my air conditioner was not blowing at all. I had forgotten that I purchased this a month ago and I called my husband to ask him if I should take the car to our mechanic. He told me to go home and hook this up and see if it can tell me what is wrong with the air. After a dozen or so tries to get the air on, I went inside and got the Actron CP9135 and hooked it up. I then turned the car on and the air worked fine and no error codes were reported. I am not sure if this is true, but my husband said maybe it reset the cars computer? Who knows, but it did save me a trip to the mechanic and it gives me peace of mind to know what is going on with the car. I am going to keep it in the glove compartment for future problems.Update Dec 20, 2007: My car was shuddering a bit at low speeds and stops. I immediately plugged this in and found out that my 6th cylinder spark plus was not firing. Took it to the mechanic and had my spark plugs replaced. Saved $109 off the dealers \"diagnosis fee\"!"
