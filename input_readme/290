"My brother purchased one of these at a trade show for almost double what it sells for here. After I saw it, I had to have one too. This thing is put together very well, with quality parts and good fit and finish. If you have the water pressure, using this will probably allow you to roll a small dog or cat down your driveway (not that you should, but you'd be able to)! Operation is smooth and it's comfortable in the hand. Made in China."
