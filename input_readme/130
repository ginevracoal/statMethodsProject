"The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10\" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6\" long. It states that the funnel is 4\" x 4\" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4\" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless."
