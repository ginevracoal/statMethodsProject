"I used this on the interior walls of the air chamber of my fireplace insert to absorb the blower noise.  I did not notice a dramatic difference.  It is on the bottom of the plenum where the cool air goes in, not in the top portion.  There were no problems with odor or melting from the heat radiating through the bottom.  I don't know what would happen if I burned wood without turning on the blowers."
