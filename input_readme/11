"I seem to use jumper cables at least several time every year; usually on someone else's car. I've &#34;rescued&#34; a few strangers in parking lots because I keep cables in my cars. The 20' length is a safety feature; you shouldn't have to lay these cables across an engine bay to reach a battery. Aluminum wire? Well, these are consumer grade. They'll get the job done at reasonable cost."
