"This was recommended to us as a way to ease keeping our windshield clean when pulling a trailer. However, on first use it did a lot more for us than expected. The first time it rained after I used RainX was on a cross-country trip last week, and amazingly it almost completely eliminated the need to use windshield wipes even during downpours. Water drops still land on the windshield, but immediately rolls off whenever the car is moving, leaving a very clear view through the windshield - much clearer than even with wipers on high. For those who have flown small planes, the effect is much the same, and why such planes don't even have wipers. (At air speeds, wind pushes raindrops off the windshield very nicely all by itself.)The only time we needed to use the wipers in several days of rain and snow driving was when passing trucks, as those covered the windshield with clouds of tiny droplets that were hard to see through.A week later, I'm noticing the windshield no longer clears itself at speeds under 40 MPH, so it may be due for another treatment, but still stays nicely clear at highway speeds, and is very easy to clear at lower speeds with a single pass of the wipers."
