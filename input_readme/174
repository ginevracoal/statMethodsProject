"I just finished using this for the first time today. Lately I'd been using a flexible squeege to begin drying my car then follow up with a chamois.WHAT A DIFFERENCE!! Rarely does one come across an item that works exactly as advertized. This one does! Now I use the chamois for the tires and wheels and the Absorber for the car. Unbelievable how much water that thing can suck up and hold! Try it. You'll love it."
