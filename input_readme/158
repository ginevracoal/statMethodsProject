"I know these have many many uses but I just use it to dry my car after a good wash.  You will be surprised by how much water this thing will hold.  You keep it damp in the tube for storage so it's always ready to go when you need it.  If it dries out just wet it again and it's good to go.  I wash this in the laundry and it cleans up nice, so easy to use and care for."
