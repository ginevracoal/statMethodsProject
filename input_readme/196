"I am a car RV detail guy. My car and RV must be shining new all the time. I thought I had found the best shine wax protection using an rv wax called protect-all with UV inhibitors in it prior to trying this Flagship wax and used it for years and it did the job and nothing else on the market ( so I thought) was going to top it for fiberglass. I use McGuires Fiberglass restorer and that did the most amazing removal of oxidation on an older RV I restored back to new so I knew it had to be good and tried it.I ADDED REVISED REVIEW TO END OF ORIGINAL REVIEW ON THIS PAGE.........................................................................................................................Well after applying this Flagship wax to my already clean and shiny RV it took the shine to a whole higher level. 1st off it does go on easy, once on its stays kind of moist like but drys SOFT LIKE but it comes off nice, then I follow with 2nd dry cloth to make sure its completly off and shiny and it does come off easy and it does clean finish up leaving a nice shiny glazed surface. But you need to change up rags often because it cakes and smears if you dont.I read reviews on Amazon which enticed me to give it a try. One said dont let dry any longer then 3 min and bottle claims same ( This is very true I am so pleased at results.The biggest improvment was the nice gold painted bottom of the Motorhome where the paint looked good before but now the paint looks glazed, shiny, and rich like I never was able to get this high a shine before. It also does not cling to plastic, windows or rubber everything it touches it comes off of leaving a high shine on it, So I used it on everything.NOW THIS IS MY REVISED REVIEW AS OF AUGUST 2013. AFTER USING THIS AND LIKING IT AT 1ST... I FOUND IT WILL CONTINUE TO BEAD BUT WATER STREAKS SEEM TO STICK AND STAY ON WAXED SURFACE ON FIBERGLASS EVEN WASHING WONT REMOVE THEM EASY. SO I WENT BACK TO USING PROTECT-ALL ON MY RV. IT SHINES AS WELL BUT ALSO THE WATER STREAKS ARE MINIMAL AFTER A RAIN AND WASH OFF EASIER.I also find the protect-all brand wax to last long and come off cleaner after applying wax leaving a cleaner shine.Making it far easier to do a big RV in less time then Flagship wax. I FOUND fLAGSHIP TO BE CAKY THICK AND HARDER TO REMOVE AND HAVING TO CONSTANTLY GET FRESH RAGS TO MAKE IT EASY TO GET OFF.........So we tried it- liked it at first but then a week or so later found the flagship to not be as good as what I used for years in the Protect-all brand. I LOVE McGUIRES PRODUCTS MOST TIMES."
