"This is an excellent chamois!  I have used many different kinds, in fact my last purchase from Amazon included this one as well as a fancy one with a waffle pattern design.  Let's just say that this outperformed that other one and I am confident in saying that this does just as good of a job as a leather one, without the process of breaking it in.  This is a great deal for the price.  Great for after washing your car or after a heavy rain."
