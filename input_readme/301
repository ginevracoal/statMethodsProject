"This is a very good nozzle. It allows a good amount of control of the water spray pattern, ranging from a wide fan delivering a low pressure water stream, through to a high pressure, narrow stream. Perfect for cleaning cars (using a medium fan of water to get the car wet and to rinse off the soap, and a high pressure spray to remove road grime from the wheels and underside). It's good for watering plants too, using the fan end of the selector range. If you get it just right you can actually get it to mist too.The only thing this nozzle is missing is a quick on/off mechanism. As it is, you turn it off by rotating the front to one end or the other. This is the same mechanism used to select the spray pattern. This is a design improvement over the original, which only had the off position at one end of the spray selection.The rubber coated aluminum design is very sturdy and will last for years... the last one did. The only reason I had to replace the last one was my mistake... I left it attached to the hose for a few years and either the hard water or electrolysis caused it to become permanently stuck to the brass end of the hose, and it got damaged when I tried to remove it. Lesson learned... I remove it from the hose when it's not in regular use."
