"This is a good size to buy and is enough oil to service a filter several times. The K&N oil has red dye in it so you can see when you have achieved full coverage. Great filters that when maintained, one filter will last as long as the car will last. Catches dirt better than the paper filters. The K&N filter gave my truck a slight increase in acceleration. When I removed a new clean paper Fram filter and put the K&N in, I took it for a road test. On a dry asphalt road, straight line acceleration from a stop, my truck broke the tires loose every time. Put the Fram back in as a test and it was again not quite able to do it. Put the K&N back in and again it was able to break the tires loose every time. Never quite had enough power to do that before. Not a huge difference but a difference none the less. When you clean your K&N be sure NOT to use hot water while cleaning. Hot water can make the filter shrink in places, causing it to become uneven. After cleaning and recoating with the oil. Mine still looks just like a new one. I put the K&N in while the truck was almost brand new and now it has 234,000 miles on it in 13 years. Same air filter and the engine has never been apart. The engine absolutely has wear, but no smoke yet and still runs good."
