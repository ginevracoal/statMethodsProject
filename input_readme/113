"Works great in refilling oil in my generator and lawnmower!It even has a lip on the top so the oil won't go out of the funnel.The only problem with funnels is, you never know how full the chamber is,and always need to remove the funnel to look. Someone should invent a meter on the funnel, that helps in overflowing,and an end valve in case the chamber is full, to prevent it from overflowing.But until then, this funnel will do just fine!"
