"As long as you take the time to make sure all adjustments are initially done correctly they are a breeze to install and take off. You must make sure that the feet are adjusted properly. I made marks on my factory mirrors so that I install them in the same spot every time. Once installed make sure the straps are as tight as you can get them. I have had little or no trouble with vibration. Anytime you hang something on a mirror that wasn't intended to have something hanging there and then go down a not so smooth road you are going to get some vibration. I don't care who makes it. This design was well thought out and works great on our 07 Jeep Wrangler. At speeds up to 75 mph I have very little movement to none. The only time I get any vibration or movement is at expansion joints or rough roads. To sum it all up I would make this purchase again and would recommend it to others who have the same type of factory mirrors as mine. I think that they would work for most applications as long as you take the time to adjust them properly."
