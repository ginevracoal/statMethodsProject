"I have two complaints about this product.  The first may be a fluke, but the something is something you should be aware of before you buy this.Issue 1) Arrived scratched, because of no protective coating.  The mirror arrived in a blister pack, which is fine, but had a lot of abrassion scratches on the front of it, which is not.  It isn't bad enough to warrant the hassle of a return, for a product this cheap, but I am certainly disappointed.  Since I only bought one, I don't know if this scratching is a trend, but I kind of suspect that it is becaus of the lack of a protective film.Issue 2) Objects in mirror are MUCH closer than they appear.  It makes things look tiny.  This may be fine if you are using this to see cars, but to see people coming from behind you in an office environmnet, it is largely ineffective.Though I usually am a big fan of buying online, from Amazon.com, this item might be better purchased in a brick and mortar store, so you can see how it will look, and ensure it isn't scratched."
