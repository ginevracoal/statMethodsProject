"Works excellent! Get the Aerosol over the liquid if you have the pod style filter or flat corrugated style for sure. It spays nice and even. I have used them both, the spray, and the liquid and the spray is the way to go for these. If you do have the older all foam style filters then get the liquid (squirt/pour kit or bottle) it will last you longer."
