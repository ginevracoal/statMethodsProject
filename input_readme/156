"I recommend these to anyone who has bitched about drying their car.I used this product and was blown away buy how well it absorbed and better yet the wring out was so easy,3 folds and a twist and 90% of the water was out!I bought one of the Chemical Guys Waffle Micro fiber cloths and it was awesome,but when you go to wring it out the shear size (25&#34;x36&#34;) made it very hard to get a good wring out.Their towel did almost 80% of my car, 2 from those would be an alternative.I give this product A+ and it is worth every penny!"
