"I never used this product, but have been told by many who have to try it and I wont be disappointed. I applied with a paper towel after each wash and I can say when it rains the water seems to fly off the windshield as if it were being pushed off with an air dryer. Each application seems to last very well for about 2-3 weeks or in between each wash. Try it and you wont be disappointed."
