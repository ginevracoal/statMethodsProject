"The 2 x 2 Inch mirrors are a good fit for 2006 Honda Pilot. I had to order via Amazon since I couldn't find these anywhere - it appears local auto stores only carry the 3 x 3 inch size. These little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item - they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well."
