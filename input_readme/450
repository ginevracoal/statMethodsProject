"I used to have the round mirror.  After getting a new SUV i decided to shop immediately on amazon for a new blind spot mirror and i found this.I decided to try this product based on user review and did the right thing.  These mirrors are perfect for my Outlander 2011 side mirrors.  I like the shape and very clear mirrors.  Although i should have gotten the 3x3 but still this 2x2 works.  Just make sure you purchase 2.  Since this is not sold in pair...  I had this mistake thinking it was sold in pair.. good think i got Amazon prime :"
