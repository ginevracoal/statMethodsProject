"I bought two sets / 4 total. I use them near the middle of the lifting range which puts the saddle about 18 to 19 inches high. This is perfect to get my truck off the ground and give me an inch or so of ground clearance to R&R; the tires and do other work underneath the vehicle.I don't need 6t worth of lift, but I like how these j/s have a wide lifting range. With these set for my range (as stated above), they are not teetering at the top of the range like others I've used in the past, but are comfortably in the middle. They are very stable and solid units.It would be helpful if the info stated the lifting range of the units, not just the tonnage they can support as a pair.Min. Lift Height (in.)14 29/32Max. Lift Height (in.)23 1/2"
