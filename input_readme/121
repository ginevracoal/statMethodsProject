"This is a GREAT funnel for what it is desinged to do. ADD FUEL ADDITIVES to your gas tank. No drips or spills on the side of your car. (LOOK at the picture) For other applications, maybe a larger or different style funnel is better. Price SHIPPED TO YOUR DOOR tax free is VERY GOOD. ($3.36)(The list price $23.88 probably should be $3.88) :)I like it and would buy it again."
