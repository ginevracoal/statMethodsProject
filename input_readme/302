"This is a very durably built nozzle, with great thick rubber group and a spin that feels really smooth & solid. I can imagine this thing lasting for years.  The only drawback I find is that for those who turn it on and off frequently, there is a decent amount of friction involved in turning all the way off to all the way on, so it's not as quick to use as a trigger shot."
