"I find it much easier to use this chamois over a towel while drying a car.  The absorber works well with soaking up water then with a quick squeeze your back at drying.  The chamois does not leave cloth and lint on your car like towels and old shirts.  I also use a damp chamois to wipe down the interior dash and seats of my vehicle, which works very well.  I would also recommend a soft water blade to use first after rinsing your vehicle to do the large areas and windows...then go back over it with the chamois.  It will cut your car drying time in half and work x2 as good. You are supposed to keep the chamois damp so when I am done I just put it back in the case and it will stay damp until my cars next wash.  It is supposed to extend the life of the chamois."
