"You'd better trust your Jack Stands if you have any intention of getting under your car.I thought these were a good option but I changed my mind after receiving them...For whatever reason, justified or not, I felt uneasy seeing how much they rattle.I decided to take my car to the mechanics and ended up never using them. I forgot to return them and then it was too late...So two stars because they do not inspire me any confidence."
