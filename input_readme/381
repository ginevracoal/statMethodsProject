"Why all the hype they have bad welds, they have this that or the other.....  Sometimes you get a bad product.  Does not mean that all the products are defective.  I purchased a set this past week and they have 100% perfect welds.  The product is in perfect shape and comes complete with instructions.  if you get a bad set, send them back.  Amazon takes them back.  I am a welder and a mechanic.  Yes, I've gotten bad products, but it doesn't mean you berate the product to death.  They have worked fine under a Kubota with a back hoe attached.  They do the job that they are supposed to do.  If you seem to think the product is defective send them back, get another set and rate what is used.  I feel completely safe working under these and have!"
