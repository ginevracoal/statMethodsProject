"I avoided dynamat for the longest time because it's pricey for the coverage area.  However after researching this, it's not easy to find a comparable material.  I covered the interior walls of my dryer (I posted a photo above) and it reduced the low rumbling noise considerably.  Dynamat Xtreme is a butyl rubber compound covered by aluminum foil.  The butyl is viscoelastic - it has just the right consistency between solid and liquid to provide maximum sound damping.  The foil probably provides some level of fire resistance, since it is hard for a fire to develop without oxygen when it is sandwiched in between the metal layer.  Cheap alternatives that some people use include the asphalt based rolls of roof sealer.  However that stuff will smell bad when it heats up (whereas butyl doesn't have such odor) and it doesn't have an aluminum layer so it's more dangerous if it were to catch fire, and asphalt can ooze into a liquid.  The closest thing I have come across that resembles Dynamat Xtreme is Hard Cast Foil Grip 1402, a specialty tape sold to contractors for HVAC duct sealing.  This HVAC tape, a favorite of mine for all kind of sealing uses, is much thinner though.  It's also a butyl compound with a foil layer and is also very expensive.  Overall I haven't found any hardware store generic material that is as good as Dynamat Xtreme for sound damping on large panels.  The price here is pretty good - I called around to some local retailers and they wanted almost twice as much for this kit."
