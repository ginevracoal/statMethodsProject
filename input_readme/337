"It's no wonder Jay Leno and other serious car restorers use this stuff.  It works!  Depending on the car you're working on, disassembly could take some time, but it's worth it.  Getting the bulk pack is the way to go - much cheaper in the long run.I put this in an Escort ZX2, and it made a huge difference.  It was like my ears were stuffed up (but they weren't).  I did the hood, doors, floor, and trunk.  Actually installing it is a breeze.  Cut it with a utility knife, remove the backing, and put it down.  Then just roll over it with a roller of some kind to make sure it grips.For tricky shapes, I used paper or cardboard templates.  Even if you make a mistake cutting, it hardly matters.  Cut it too big? Just cut some more away.  Cut it too small?  Just add some more.This is not a job to do when it is ten degrees outside.  Wait till spring or summer when the Dynamat is easier to work with."
