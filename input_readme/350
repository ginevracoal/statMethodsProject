"I ordered two for my garage. They are the right thing I needed. The rubber is soft enough to hold it's own shape, but won't damage the vehicle's paint. I may punch a hole in the middle since it is already beginning to sag. And, it has the lovely &#34;made in China&#34; stench. The rubber smells strong, and is probably toxic, but it was only $8.No one lives forever.-Oingo Boingo"
