"I've been climbing around under cars since 1959 and these jack stands are sweet.  One can drop a four wheel drive on these puppies and they're not going flex.  Or one can get their sports car up to a \"DECENT\" working height of a shade under twenty-four inches.It doesn't matter if these have a capacity of six tons each or they're six tons for two of them because they're shipped and you're going use them......as a pair.  Our full size F-250, with tool boxes is 8,800 pounds so what do I care if they're not six tons each?  They're going be holding up a single corner or side of the vehicle at a time.  In the meantime, the spec sheet packaged inside the box the jack stands are packed in, clearly spec these jacks at 6T \"each.\"If you need to be reassured, call the manufacture's customer service line between 8-5 PST @ 1-888-448-6746 and let customer service tell you directly what the truth is regarding any of your questions.On our jack stand copy, I checked the delivered jack stand base welds and found all gusset welds and manufacturing quality control, to be good to excellent manufacturing/welding.  I checked out the stamped sheet metal parts and found the stamped sheet metal work to be \"excellent.\"  There was nothing in the manufacturing of our jack stands that would seem abnormal (a standout), cheap or inappropriate for a product of this kind.This is not a high end, tech grade, stainless steel, high pressure fitting where each weld is x-ray'd.  This is a typical red and black jack stand one uses at home or a shop to support a car, pickup, flatbed or box truck for the purpose of safely making repairs under a jacked up vehicle.  Used normally, with safety in mind during proper placement, there's no reason to believe that if you use these jack stands, you won't be able to safely get under a vehicle, make your repairs and get on to the next item on your check list.Overall, I am very pleased with the pair of auto jacks we received and I feel comfortable recommending these beasts to all who find themselves to be mechanically inclined and in need of safely crawling around under their jacked up vehicle."
