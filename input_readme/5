"I purchased the 12' feet long cable set and they arrived in a retail cardboard box with handle, which could be used as a storage and carrying case for these cables, although I will not need to store them with the carry box.  These are high quality long cables of high grade materials and I believe worth the price I paid for them.  They will store in the back seat storage compartment of my truck easily.  Recomend."
