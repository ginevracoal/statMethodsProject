"This will be the 773rd review for this product, so I'm guessing that this is not the first one you've read. It's safe to assume you already know enough about how it works. As such, I may not have a lot of information to add, except for the fact that I've had this nozzle for at least five years.  I'm not sure exactly when I bought it, but it was definitely no later than 2009.I've used it consistently over that time, for washing the car, hosing off the patio by the pool, washing the dog, cleaning the pool filter, etc etc. It's heavy-duty enough to drop on the concrete, it just lands with a dull thud from that thick rubber ring around the end, and years of abuse haven't affected it in the slightest.  The stream selection by rotating the outer ring is still as smooth as the day I bought it.Being able to turn it off at either end of the rotation is a nice feature too, less messing with it when you're done using it. I had intended to buy another one for the hose in the back of the house, but instead I've just been switching this one back and forth as necessary.If you're looking through these reviews because you're interested in buying one (why else would you be?), get one.  It's worth the money."
