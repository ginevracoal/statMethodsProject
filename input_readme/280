"This nozzle is built like a tank and will last forever from the looks of it and from the 10 year old my neighbor has.I have the bad habit of sometimes leaving my hose water turned on so that I can have instant water at the nozzle.  Not the brightest idea as your hose can burst or your nozzle can fail.A few months ago my neibhgor came by and told me that I had a leak.  I looked around and sure enough, my old nozzle had failed.  My neighbor mentioned, \"that there's your problem neighbor - that crumby plastic nozzle you're using.\"His has been going strong for 10 years.  So I ordered this from Amazon rather than going through two warehouses stores hunting for it.I must say that I'm very impressed.PROS- very solid construction, either aluminum or steel- padded with thick rubber- looks like fireman's hose- smoothly fades from closed to soaker to rain to fan to jet with a simple twist- easy to work with wet handsCONS- noneNow I will tell you that the jet on this nozzle is one of the best I've seen but I'm not going to compare this to a pressure washer, I have one and nothing compares to a pressure washer, but the jet mode of this is pretty darn good.I recommend you get one and I also recommend you close your water at the faucet when not in use."
