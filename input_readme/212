"These are the perfect size for the tires on an rv trailer - 15&#34;. I had some that were too large and didn't fit the curve of the tire so weren't very effective. These fit perfectly and hold extremely well. If you put a loop of rope through the hole, it makes it easier to remove them from under your tires."
