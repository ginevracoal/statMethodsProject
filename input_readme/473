"fast shipping and a good price. I bought the 32oz cleaner and the 12.25oz oil aerosol separately instead of the combo kit, better value that way, you get more for your money. Havnt used the oil yet im waiting for the filter to completely dry over night before I spray it with the oil. The cleaner worked GREAT just spray it on wait 10 min. and rinse with the hose, filter looks brand new. Il spay it with the oil tomorrow and Im good to go !"
