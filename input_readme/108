"This is absolutely one of the best four and a half bucks I have ever spent. I originally thought I would use it to pour gas into lawn care devices but when it arrived my wife had a need for a funnel to use in the kitchen. She scrubbed it thoroughly and it worked fine for her. In addition, she said it looked like one of the old time hearing aids. Amazingly, she was right on target. By holding the small end to my ear I could clearly hear her, the TV and the telephone. To my utter surprise all sounds are clearly amplified. I never would have believed it if I had not experienced this for myself. There are some frequencies which I have some difficulty in hearing now that I have \"matured\". My wife's voice is one of them so this is a handy aid when I want to hear something that she does not clearly elucidate. For convenience it even has a loop on the wide end where I can insert a chain or rope to hang around my neck. The uses for this item are nearly endless and I will order another one to serve the original purpoe for which I bought this one which is for pouring gas and oil.This is truly a multi-purpose tool and at a bargain price."
