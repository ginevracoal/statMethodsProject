"Does a great job cleaning grime that collects on KN filters for my truck and twin intakes on G37s. Less than 10 minutes of soaking and it removes the old oil and dirt. Rinse with water and blow dry with a hair dryer or even a leaf blower and your ready to reapply new oil that allows the flow through fabric to filter out fast flowing intake."
