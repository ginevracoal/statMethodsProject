"Can see the same welding issues as the other users, though I'm not sure if it would affect the maximum load (2 tons) the jack stands can hold. Sturdy jack stands, might be slightly high for some cars, depending on what you are trying to do (being too high isn't awful - you just need to jack your car up a little more).Overall, simple no frills car jack stands. Has a safety pin mechanism to to keep the jack stand locked, as well as the regular locking handle."
