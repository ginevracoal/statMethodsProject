"I put this over the ceiling vent in my bedroom and it does the job. The magnets seemed stronger than those on the one I put in my living room, purchased locally. My vents size required this deflector to be pulled out to it's max length which put it right on the edge of not holding together but it does and it does the job. It has been up there for several day's now and I expect no problems from it."
