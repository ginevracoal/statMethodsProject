"I have a Wrangle-X but it's got the Rubicon wheel package so the tires are 255/75-17 (I don't know what all the numbers mean so I just post them all).  I bought the 2X size and it fits good, coming over the back side by about 2\", feeling snug and secure.  I don't really see the \"denim\" look but at least it doesn't have the shiny look.  Material feels durable, should last pretty good."
