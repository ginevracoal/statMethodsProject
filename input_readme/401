"No real complains about it. Fits and does it's job. Even the wide one doesn't completely go around my steering wheel. My wheel isn't huge either. So this was meant for a skinny steering wheel. But it feels good and was easy to install. One of the plastic strings broke. But I just wrapped it around the wheel, tied a knot in it, and continued to wrap it around the wrap. Not a big deal. Happens with this style of wrap often."
