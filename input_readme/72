"It is perfect to secure your spare tire to tire carrier or bumper. Easy to use and sturdy. Is not a eyesore, and seems well made, i highly recommend this to keep thieves honest, it wont guarentee a determined thief wont steal your expensive wheel/tire, but when the thief see's the steel cable wrapped through the wheel, it won't be so much a snatch and grab. Some piece of mind to myself. I run 31.10.50 x 15&#34; wheels (over $350 each wheel/tire x 5 = $1750), with a Smitybilt tire carrier, the 36&#34; cable was plenty long enough."
