"Great to protect the edges of your Car Doors in the garage, from bumping the wall & scuffing the paint off the edges. I need to buy another pack though, for the back doors protection too, as it is not long enough for both doors. We don't need it for the back doors very often, but I think it will come in handy at times. Since we like this so much, we will be buying another."
