"I was prepared to write a &#34;sham-why&#34; review because initially this thing acted like a sheet of nonabsorbent rubber, but once it started soaking water it seemed to 'open up' and began working pretty well.  It wrings out easily and leaves no lint, which is pretty rad,  because the old bath towels I was using before made my car fuzzy."
