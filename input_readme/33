"The California Car Duster has been so much more than I expected. I keep a good finish on my car and it is garaged year-round. Washing the car was (many times) simply a matter of hosing off the dust. This does a damn nice job of dusting all of the car surfaces quickly and easily. Sometimes I get lazy and the car duster saves me a full car wash. Try it!"
