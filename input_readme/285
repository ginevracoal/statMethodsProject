"Maybe they moved to China don't know.  Bought first one ten years (?) ago.  So much better than any other in my life that I sent another to my brother who says the same.  China may or may not lower quality.Bought about three since the first one.  They were copy cats, two I think from HD, junk, total junk.  Felt like they were restricting the flow at any setting.  Poor jet shape or any other compared to original.  Remember I had the old one for comparison which defined \"perfect\".After several throw aways bought another $20 one from Amazon.  Think the metal part is aluminum in old and new if that matters.  The most recent works just like the old one and on less pressure because the first hose bibb in front yard is ahead of the pressure valve all home have.  Whoops, just noticed in the pic here at Amazon, front nozzle is stainless on both of mine but the colored body toward the rear looks like anodized aluminum on both of mine.So China or not I have old and new and they are equal in performance.  Of the many things in life that never seem to be right this Bon-Aire Original Ultimate is settled.  None have worked better for me and I look no more.  Suddenly my wife springs to mind.................LOL??"
