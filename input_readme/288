"2 different hoses, totally different results. I typically use a light duty pocket hose to wash my car since it's easier to tote around, but it doesn't flow nearly enough pressure for this nozzle. I switched to my standard 3/4\" rubber hose and it was night and day. This nozzle NEEDS a high-volume hose to function properly. Build quality is second to none, but I knocked it down a star because my other nozzles work just fine with my light duty hose."
