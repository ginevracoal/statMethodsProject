"I'm sure all of you out there that love yours really love them.  I have to go with the \"So-so\" people here.For years I have been a fan of the little 1\" brass tip-style nozzles but all of a sudden can't find them anymore.  Isn't that the way it works!?The pressure on the Bon-Aire doesn't compare to those little guys.  (not to mention the price)  You get more water with the Bon-Aire,  but not the great pressure I have experienced from the little tip-style sprayers.  I consider my house average pressure. Not the greatest, but not low, so I figured with all the great reviews here it would work for me with my 3/4\" hose.  Disappointed.  No doubt it is quality and looks like it will last forever.  I was surprised  at how large it actually is and maybe that has something to do with the lack of pressure.  There is a use for it for sure, but I certainly would not consider it a \"dream\" nozzle in the least.  Maybe it works like a charm with homes that have high pressure.  I would not recommend it for those of us with average and low pressure unless you just want a spayer that gives you lots of water and so/so pressure."
