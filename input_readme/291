"I didn't like this hose nozzle as much as other reviewers.  For the price, I was expecting an amazing nozzle.  It is heavy, sturdy, and looks like it will be very durable, but I do not like the selection of the spray patterns compared to the $5 hose nozzles at home improvement stores.  The rubber areas are comfortable to hang on to.This would be great for washing a car or big jobs like hosing down a pool or screens, but for watering potted plants and trees, this nozzle puts too much water down and creates splashing."
