"I bought a set of these thinking they were the same as my 6 ton jack stands.  Luckily, my mistake made my life easier.  I was always that anything less than a 6 ton jack is just too flimsy if you're working on a truck or SUV.  I turns out that these little guys aren't flimsy at all.  And the added lock, while completely unnecessary, does provide a bit of extra reassurance when you're under a vehicle.  I would definitely buy again."
