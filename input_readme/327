"Wow, this stuff works well!  We have a wall air conditioner in our home.  It is a quiet variety that we paid a good deal of money for, due to that claim.  It still had a bad resonance of some vibrating metal on the machine.I applied this to all accessible (front face) surfaces, and only the spots where there was not a decal or other item present, probably less than 30% of the total frontal surface (keep in mind 50% is the evaporator and blower vent), and the available space on the front cover.  Wow, we can definitely hear a difference in the room it is installed in.This thing has a strong resonance, so we can still hear it in other spaces.  I feel like it doesnt dampen all modes, but it certainly does enough for a noticeable difference in the space where we have the AC located."
