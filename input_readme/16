"These are an insurance policy for my Land Rover.  An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  These are heavy weight and appear to be solidly built.  As I haven't used them, it's difficult to talk about function.  That being said, I'm happy enough with the construction to give them a solid 4.  You get what you pay for, and this is certainly worth it."
