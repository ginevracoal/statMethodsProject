"I really like the double locking feature as a backup incase the release lever got kicked or something. These stands also have a pretty good lift range. The welds aren't the best like others have pointed out but that's just what you're going to get at this price point. I'll probably reweld them at some point but for now they still far exceed my needs.I bought the 6 ton stands because while I'm not certain they're strong enough to support 6 tons (3 tons each of course) they are definitely strong enough to support any normal vehicle. Remember that the weight of the vehicle is divided up amongst the stands. With the exception of the very biggest configuration of the very biggest 1 ton diesel pickup available most big non-commerical trucks weigh less than 1 ton per corner so even if these stands can only manage a third of their rated weight they are still overkill for most trucks let alone cars.Basically the welds should be better but these things are still very strong and perfectly fine for normal passenger vehicles."
