"I've been using K&N Filters in my cars since I was about 20 or so. It's truly amazing the amount of particulate they catch, and this oil is a huge part of that process. I find it heaps easier to buy a can every now and then through amazon, instead of hunting it down at the local auto parts store, who may or may not have it, depending on any number of ridiculous things."
