"For about the cost of 3 throw away filters, you get a lifetime filter that provides better air flow.  I was due to replace my filter anyhow, spent a little extra an got this.  It popped into my '07 Altima 3.5 without any tools.  A perfect fit.  There's a decal to add to air intake box so that hopefully future service personnel (Jiffy Lube and the like) won't keep trying to change the filter for you."
