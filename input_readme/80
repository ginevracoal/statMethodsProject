"We use this when we'll be on the road (more than 250 miles). We go to Maine every year from Florida and I do most of the driving at night when a cleaner windshield is nice to have. I mix it with distilled water and their 2 in 1 glass cleaner. While on the interstate I rarely need the windshield wipers if I clean the windshield well before heading out."
