"Five stars for price and for doing exactly what it is supposed to do.  It also seems to be unbreakable in that it survived shipping.  Amazon didn't pack the box very well; I guess taking the manufacturer at its word and the claim that it is unbreakable.  I purchased two of these, both of which came in boxes that were utterly smashed up by heavier items in the box.  Both arrived unscathed anyway, although with one, the two halves had come apart.  It slid back together easily, so no big deal.I am using these on standard HVAC registers in our new house.  In two places we ended up needing to place furniture over top of a register.  We wanted something to direct the airflow out from under the furniture instead of blowing air into the bottom of it.  These do that well, and the magnets have held them in place.  Just slide the sides apart to the width you need and set them down.  Done.  I would recommend them, and will buy more if we rearrange things and need to cover other registers."
