"I was looking for a receiver lock that was easy to use and give us the protection for our hitch.  We typically dont unhook the hitch after arriving at the site and always worried that someday someone might remove it.  Now we dont have to worry and my wife is much happier!!!The rubber cover for the key area keeps dirt away from lock mechanism.  Plus it is a Master Lock...enough said."
