"These are so wonderful to have in the car in the winter. After getting one of these in another color (but the same brand), I decided to pick up a second blanket for my kids to use too while traveling. Here in Minnesota it gets extremely cold and everyone is always fighting over where to have the thermostat set at. By having some of these travel electric blankets in the car, everyone can keep as warm as they want to.This blanket works just as well as my other one and gets just as warm, just as fast. It works exactly like a household electric blanket does. I was so pleased with how well they worked that I bought some as gifts for people for Christmas this year. They were a BIG it and no one knew they even made such a thing. Finally with these we can all be as warm and toasty as we want to be!"
