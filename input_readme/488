"Washed the filter on a Friday evening and the filter was dry Saturday evening.  Sprayed on the oil on Sunday afternoon.  Very easy to do on a 2008 GMC Sierra 3500 HD Diesel.  My main concern with the dealer doing it was that they might not have let the filter dry completely before re-oiling it.  How would I have ever known if it were done correctly?  They said it would take about an hour.  I don't know how the filter could have ever dried &#34;naturally&#34; as is required by K&N, in only one hour.  I'm glad I did it myself and I bet you will be too.  This kit will probably last for at least three recharges."
