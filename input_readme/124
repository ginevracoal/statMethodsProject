"I love this funnel, it has so many uses. For example I can pour a liquid into a container with a small opening with great ease. I can hang it on a wall and it will wait there until I need to pour another liquid into a container with a small opening again. Let's see a hammer do either of those things. My hammer never stays put. You can reason with this funnel, it has an open mind so to speak. Others may try but they all fall short of the splendor that is this funnel."
