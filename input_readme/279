"I musta spent a gazillion dollars on nozzles from wally world, k-notsmart, etc. I just wish I had bought one of these in the first place! I heard about it from a friend who owns several aircraft and he says it's the best for use around aircraft. I figure if it's good enough for his airplanes, it's good enough for me! Love it!"
