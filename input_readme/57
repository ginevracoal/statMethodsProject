"The price was right and it was delivered on time, however, it was not as durable as I imagined and was a little smaller than it looked to be in the picture.  It was also a little flimsy when extended to it's supposed maximum size.  I would not buy it again as my vents are larger and this is just not adequate for the intended purpose.  However, if the vents were not as wide, it would be acceptable."
