"We have cars with full of electronic gadgets so they consume significant electricity, even when car is being driven. Almost every week we get no start due to weak battery. I have an external car battery charger (old). It is bulky to setup to charge cars overnight. Also it does not have any detection, so the battery can be continuously overcharged, which will eventually damage the battery (as multiple battery experts tell me). Never learned our lesson as we had 3 quality batteries purchased and replaced - each within 2 years.After reading all the great reviews, I bought one of these on-board charger and installed in one of the car that frequently dies (even with new battery). Now I can just plug in to the wall when car is parked each night, and unplug in the morning before the commute. No need to check if charging is complete if not driven for days! Also it will reduce the risk of not able to start the car to almost none.I will be buying another one for our other electronic gadgets-heavy car...  The next convenient thing is to find a good retractable power cords that can either be installed in the car with the on-board charger, or to the outlets for which the charger will be tapping power from."
