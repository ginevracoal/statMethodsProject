"at 30bux this is a steal! any store sells this for 50 which is so high. K&N makes the best filters and for a drop in this works great. I modded my intake and used this drop in filter and noticed about 2-3 more mpg(thats alot considering i used to get 11mpg on my truck, now i get anywhere from 12-15 no lie!), also makes my engine a bit louder which is a plus i think."
