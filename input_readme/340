"I used this video to quiet a steel enclosure for a CNC mill. The product works perfectly. The amount I bought was overkill, but I saved on shipping and actual product price. My plan is to contact local stereo installers to see if they want to buy my surplus. If not, there are a myriad of items in my home that need some damping :) Used a wallpaper seam roller which worked fine."
