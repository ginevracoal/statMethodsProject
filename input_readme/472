"This can be used to clean so many things. When I cleaned my air filter and then rinsed it, I now have a very clean spot on my front sidewalk. I've used it with much success cleaning up old oil spills in the garage and cleaning window screens on the house. Highly recommended for the air filter cleaning but has many other uses as noted on the product label."
