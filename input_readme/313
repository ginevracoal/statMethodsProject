"When looking at these products, simply calculate the actual cost per square foot. for example this\"speaker kit\" contains 1.38 square feet, for around 22 bucks(price fluxuates like its a stock or something?)can u think of anything thats worth 15 dollars a square foot? there are so many cheaper alternatives. dynamat is an awsome product, and it does work. but for those of us not made of money, search this \"butyl flashing tape\" u will be glad u did."
