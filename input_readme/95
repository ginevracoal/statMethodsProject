"Product definitely works as described.  Have used this in the past on all of my vehicles (3 over the last 16 years) and it does a great job of clearing your windshield/windows of rain and misting.During light rains or when the roads are wet and mist is kicked up from the tires on the vehicle in front of you, this does a great job of keeping the beading moving up and off of the windows to the point that you don't really even need your wipers.  In moderate or heavy rains, it does a great job of keeping the water beaded up so vision isn't as reduced as it is on untreated windows.I docked one star though because i've found (thru multiple vehicles and uses) that my wiper blades doesn't seem to last as long after it has been applied.  I've also spoken with multiple friends who reported the same issue.  I haven't used this in conjunction with the RainX wiper blades so maybe that isn't an issue if you use them, but it is def noticeable with other commons brands... From the cheapest ones to the premium ones, it seems to affect the life of them all.That being said, i now only apply to the side windows, moonroof and mirrors of my vehicles. The beading the product causes helps keep the rain off which minimizes water spots as well.  Another plus especially in the spring when pollen is rampant and not washed away with constant &#34;April Showers&#34;."
