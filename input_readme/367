"They are OK jack stands nothing special. The only problems are that the double locking stick thing sometimes is not aligned properly and does not go in correctly. Also the legs are not flat when they wrap which could result in them sinking into your driveway or garage but that is not a problem for me because I primarily use them for a go kart and ATV but I have heard that it is good to get the ones with the flat legs because of those problems."
