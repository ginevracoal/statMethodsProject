"I had two sets of jack stands but only 1 1/2 tin capacity and when I got my truck, I feel questionable getting under the truck. I know they share the weight but it only takes one to fail... So I ordered two pair of these 3 ton stands. They were securely packed in the box with cover and cushion. I love the double locking safety. Very good construction and ready for use. I highly recommend this product."
