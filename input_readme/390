"My experience by no means is a proven scientific method of analysis, but the trend I have experienced with Fram filters has been one of reliability. I used Fram on everything from motorcycles, ATVs, cars and my 4x4 trucks. Not one has shown any indication of failure. My truck with over 300K miles is well within its compression window and doesn't blow the least bit of smoke. My motorcycle has over 50K miles and it too doesn't show any appreciable wear.Does that mean Fram is flawless? Nothing is, but I changed 1000s of engine oil for myself and 100s of friends over 30yrs. I am presently using this 6017A series on a Polaris ATV which is exposed to extreme conditions in the Florida swamps with much success.Maybe Fram fails easier than others when you push the envelope with going long on an oil change interval. Since I change oil religiously, I may never know what the failure point of a Fram filter is, and I am certainly not interested in finding out the hard way.I trust Fram as good balance between quality, reliability and cost."
