"takes a while to warm up, ok as the package says give it 10 minutes. warm after 2 minutes, nice after 6, toasty after 15.papers say 4A / 48W, and it comes with a spare 7A fuse for the plug.price was decent, seems to work ok, plaid seems a bit faked but still attractive; hope it will last for a while."
