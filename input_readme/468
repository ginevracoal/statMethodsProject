"I normally use the smaller recharge kit (white bottle) but since i ran out, I bought this spray and the bigger oil can to match. I used it on a k&n filter I had never cleaned and unlike the other white bottle cleaner, it did not completely remove the oil, so it is hard to say I'm 100% satisfied. I will need to test it on the other filter which I have cleaned before to see if it was just this filter. Not sure if it is the same exact formula as the white bottle and it very well could be, but I will update this when I clean the older filter again which i just cleaned with the white recharge kit so it won't be for a while. Since i don't see any other alternatives I imagine this is the only option for regular (non synthetic) k&n filter cleaner, if you can get your hands on the white bottle cleaner that works great and I can vouch for that. In this case the problem could be the filter, I have bought a few of the white recharge kits so I know how to clean filters. Time will tell"
