"I have a 2008, Ford F150 FX2 Sport, Supercab. I had never done anything with sound, to any vehicle I had ever owned, that was so extensive. I am so glad I did. I absolutely love this stuff and will probably put it in any vehicle I own, whether I do a sound system or not. It just quiets things down. It gets a bit sticky at times but comes right off your fingers. Be careful with small pieces that you want to throw away, they may end up back on the bottom of your foot. It took me a solid weekend to do the front to the back and doors. If you have the time, do it."
