"I shopped around a lot and researched sound deadeners before i bought this. i was sure of 2 things, i wanted something made of butyl, and i wanted value. there is no way i would take my truck that ive put so much time and money in, and line it with roofing tar for sound deadening to save a few dollars. when i first started looking at these product i went to lowes and looked at the peel n seel stuff. wow, i cant believe people put that in their cars. the asphaly smell was horrible, and that was in the package at 70 degrees on the shelf. cant imagine at 100 degrees in summer. I wanted to go with another product that is like dynamat but its backordered for months. so i grabbed this to get started with. product is easy to work with. went on great and makes a nice difference. one of the few products that works as soon as u put it on and shud last forever. definatly pricey for what it is, but amazon had the best deal.The Tip: ive found an incredible sound deadener, i had a \"memory foam\" mattress topper laying around. after the dynamat, i backed it with the foam, double thick some places. now the hatch of my SUV is like a solid brick wall when u tap on it, and all the bass stays inside."
