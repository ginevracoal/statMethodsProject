"Ok, I was using a twist version of cargo bar that I did not like because it was a little cumbersome to put in. I thought this cargo bar would be easier to place in a lot let time.I hold my tool chess in place in the front of our truck bed. When I went to place this cargo bar, I could not get it tight using the ratchet at the end of the handle sweep. I found I had to rotate the handle about straight out, then give it one or two more clicks. It did slip once while I was adjusting last click. After placing in position I found it was not as sturdy as the rotating bar I was using, but went ahead and left the Ratcheting bar in place. After 200 miles of driving, bumpy roads, hills, ext.... it is still in place and working. I must note that I have a bed rug, and topper. So no slipping would occur so long as the ratchet holds. I would be on the fence to recommend this product. It will work, but not as tight as the turn stile.Update 05/22/13: OK been using for a while now, and find it is suffice to hold a good size tool box on wheels in place at the front of the box. No slipping or loosening has occurred in the 5,000 miles with this product. I would recommend this product, it does what it says, bounced to 4 star."
