"What is not to love about a cheap genuine K&N; product?  It fit in my car with zero issues and its K&N; so you know its quality.On a nice side note for the men out there,  K&N; includes a sticker to put on the air box that says the filter is a K&N; product and does not need to be replaced.  I only say this because my wife has had people who change her oil try to sell her a new one.  This was a nice thing to see in the package.  They even include a card to put in the glove box with a 1 800 number for a service station to call if they don&#8217;t believe it!I have always put a K&N; air filter in my car and as long as they are around I always will.  Plus Amazon had them for about 30-50% than other places I looked.I have no issues!"
