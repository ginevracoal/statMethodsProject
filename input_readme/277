"Buy this right now.  I had a performance K&N; filter set-up on my Acura, but for some reason it never occurred to me to put a K&N; filter on my commuter car.  It popped up as a suggestion, and I purchased it immediately.  Right away I noticed snappier acceleration.  At the end of my 22 mile commute my mileage had already improved .5 mpg without resetting the computer.  I am floored.  I am fresh out of a dyno so I don't know if my HP increased, but based on my other two observations, combined with this being a lifetime product, I am ecstatic about this filter.Now, a little story about replacing my old filter with the K&N.;  I thought I was just going to open the air box, yank out the old one, slap in the K&N;, and then go about my day.  WRONG.  Big ol' thumbs down for Nissan making routine task a big undertaking.  If you have an Altima you had better get out your awesomeStanley 92-839 Black Chrome and Laser Etched Socket Set, 99-Piece.  Use your short 10mm and remove the intake hose from where it attaches to the box.  Then you can unclip the front clips, and the lid flips up.  You can unclip the sensor, but I did not.  Thank goodness I do not have to do that again for another 50,000 miles."
