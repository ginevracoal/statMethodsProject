"Actron seems to be a company that makeshigh quality diagnostic equipment. This autoscannertool is very affordable and excellent value formoney. Works very well and is pretty ruggedas I had hoped. The only problem is that fixingthe vehicle based on the diagnosed code isNOT always helpful, sorry. Repairing your car based on thesecodes requires a good understanding of auto repair.For example: code PM001 - Cylinder Misfire. What can a NOVICEdo with ALL that \"helpful\" information (LOL). Relatively easy to use.I will give full marks for the quality of thephysical device otherwise."
