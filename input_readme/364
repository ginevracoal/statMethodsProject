"These jack stands do what they are supposed to do. My Disco 2 is about 5,000 lbs and they hold it just fine. My only advice is that you make sure you know your vehicle height. These jack stands are tall. I use them on the lowest setting on my Disco and I still have to jack it up an inch or so to get it high enough to put these under. I will be lifting it soon though, so that will change, and hence the reason I got these. For a normal car though, these would probably not be my first choice.Also, if you are using them on asphalt, be aware that they might sink down into the ground a little. On concrete you wouldn't have this problem, but asphalt is soft enough that the edges of the stands might cut through.Finally, be safe and get a good pair of wheel chalks to use."
