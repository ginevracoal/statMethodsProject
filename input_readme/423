"Easy to mount and adjust. Since each one is made identical (there is no right or left, you just mount the mirror differently), one has the tensioner lever right next to the mirror (drivers side in my case). That is not a problem if you place it back from your mirror. Good sturdy mount and no vibration. Once adjusted they are easy on and off."
