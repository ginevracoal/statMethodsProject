"This is my first purchase of rain-x. It seems to work pretty well. I do wish it lasted longer. A few weeks after application it seems to be wearing off unevenly. Also it was difficult to get a good buffing on the windshield after the first application. Once it rained the wipers seemed to even it out though."
