"I had to use my wife's 01 Honda Accord for a couple of days and I could hardly hear myself think from the road noise made by the tires on concrete. I searched around and found several products offering claims of noise reduction. I figured if this was good enough for the \"King of cool cars\" Chip Foose, then It would probably be good enough for me. I put it on the doors and the floor boards. It was fairly easy to do, get some of those nylon interior tools so you don't scar up the interior panels. Man, was I ever a smart guy. My wife had never realized how loud it was in her car until I installed this. Now she is happy as ever driving her car. She said it made it feel like a new car. Happy wife - happy life. This stuff really does help a bunch! And to think, I did this for me... and reaped the benefits for doing it for her. Thanks to Chip and Amazon (for having the best price and free shipping)!I would have given it a 6 out of 5 if I could."
