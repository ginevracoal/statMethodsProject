"so i used this to basically pressure wash my muddy ATV. it worked surprisingly well. nothing like a pressure washer but just turn on water and use this and i got 90% of it off. i had hoped for a little more power on the high pressure setting but cant really expect much i guess.i dont know how often ill use it, maybe for playing with my son, but i like the &#34;gentle soak&#34; spray. its much wider and useful than just the hose without a nozzlei would say the best 2 features are 1. the ability to shut it off going either direction and 2. even if its not much more powerful than your typical nozzle there is no holding a handle, or holding your finger over the hose to get pressure. feels like it should last a long time"
