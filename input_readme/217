"I had bought a couple of these many years ago but recently bought a travel trailer so needed 4 more (could only find one of my old ones).  They are now dated for replacement.  After buying these I found them at Walmart for $1.25 less per unit. The Walmart ones were dated a year later than the Amazon ones."
