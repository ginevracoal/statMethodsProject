"it stays stuck, on fiberglass at least.  easily cut to shape.  seems to protect.  i'm using it on the bellypan of my motorcycle track fairing, which is fiberglass.  i'm told fiberglass won't bubble like stock type fairings will, so i may not have needed it.  but i put it on just in case, and whether it's because i didn't need it or the stuff is working, but my paint isn't bubbling.  which is all i care about."
