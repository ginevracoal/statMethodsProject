"Every time it rains, my glass patio table accumulates puddles of water. Before purchasing this, it would take several large towels to clean off and dry. Now, with this chamois, all I do is wipe the entire table one time, wring out the chamois, than wipe the table again. Within minutes, the table is not only clean, but dry. This is definitely worth the money."
