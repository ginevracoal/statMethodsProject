"Pros:- works better than chamois in absorbing water.- does not produce streaks when drying cars  - Spot free!- I cut it to half and quarter sizes - makes it great for the kitchen tops, sink and bathroom- works great for kitchen spills- available almost everywhere- cheaper than chamoisCons:-You have to store it moist in the canister or it will dry stiff as a cardboard. (Dip it on water and it is good to go again).-Storing it moist promotes growth of bacteria and micro-organism. Forget about using it on your body as a towel or drying your plates, pots and utensils."
