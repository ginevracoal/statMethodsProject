"I have two vents directly over my living room sofa and although I have lived with them blowing directly on me for a long time, a suggestion by a friend, had me search out diffusers.  I am really glad that I did.The diffusers work great in re-directing the air flow off of me and either into the room or towards the windows.  The magnets hold perfectly on my ceiling vents and the diffusers appear pretty sturdy.  So far, nothing has fallen to \"crack me in the head.\"The diffusers are adjustable so that you can get them to fit even if you have a vent lever or screws that may get in the way, which I do.I am very pleased and would recommend this product in that it absolutely helps."
